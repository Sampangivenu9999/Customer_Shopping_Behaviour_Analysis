# Customer_Shopping_Behaviour_Analysis
  Data Analysis for customer purchase data to identify spending patterns and sales trends. Cleaned and processed data using Python and SQL, and visualized insights through interactive Power BI dashboards
# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior to identify purchasing patterns, preferences, and key factors influencing sales. The goal is to generate actionable insights that help improve marketing strategies, enhance customer experience, and drive business growth.
The project involves data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL-based querying, interactive dashboard creation in Power BI, and final reporting using Gamma.

# Dataset Loading
Name: Customer Shopping Behavior Dataset
Format: CSV file
Description: Contains information about customer demographics, products purchased, purchase amount, discounts, seasonality, and purchase preferences.
Key Columns:
Customer_ID, Age, Gender, Category, Purchase_Amount, Discount_Applied, ,  Review Rating

# Tools & Technologies Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data cleaning and EDA)
SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server): Data querying and aggregation
Power BI: Dashboard creation and data visualization
Gamma App: Report presentation and storytelling
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code: Code execution environment

#  Project Steps
1. Data Loading and Cleaning

Imported dataset into Python using Pandas.

Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Standardized column names and formatted data types.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, correlations, and purchase behavior across demographics.

Identified top-selling product categories and seasonal trends.

Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

3. SQL Analysis

Connected the cleaned dataset to MySQL/PostgreSQL.

Executed SQL queries for aggregation, filtering, and segmentation (e.g., top customers, most profitable category).

4. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

Imported processed data into Power BI.

Designed an interactive dashboard showcasing key metrics such as:

Total Revenue

Sales by Category and Season

Customer Segments by Age and Gender

Discount Impact on Sales

5. Reporting (Gamma App)

Created a clean, professional presentation summarizing findings and insights.

Highlighted business recommendations based on analytical results.
